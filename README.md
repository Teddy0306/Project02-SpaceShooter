# Project 02-2D Shooter

Project for MSCH-C220

A user-controlled ship for a space-shooter game. Created in Unity.

## Implementation

Created using [Unity 2022.3.45f](https://unity.com)

Assets are provided by [Kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-extension), provided under a [CC0 1.0 Public Domain License](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

The explosion spritesheet was released into the public domain by [StumpyStrust](https://opengameart.org/content/explosion-sheet)

UI buttons are provided by [Kenny.nl](https://kenney.nl/assets/ui-pack-sci-fi)

Background image is provided by [drakzlin](https://opengameart.org/content/space-background-7)

I updated the button UI and added a background image. I wanted the game to be more like a bullet hell. I added two more enemy types (three in total) that have their own movement and fire rate. The enemies and the asteroids are set up to spawn indefinitely after a set delay. I did attempt to add upgrades after a score threshold is hit, but I did not have the time to troubleshoot it.
